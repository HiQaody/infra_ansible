## Welcome

Welcome to the **infra_ansible** project! We are excited to have you here. This project aims to streamline infrastructure management using Ansible, leveraging YAML, JSON, and Jinja for configuration and templating. Your contributions are invaluable to us, and we look forward to collaborating with you!

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with YAML, JSON, and Jinja is recommended.

### Dependencies
- No additional dependencies are required at this time.

## Branch Naming Convention

We currently have one branch in this repository:

- **main**: This is the default branch where the stable code resides.

### Suggested Naming Conventions
For future branches, please follow these conventions:
- **feature/** for new features (e.g., `feature/add-new-module`)
- **bugfix/** for bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-typo`)
- **hotfix/** for urgent fixes (e.g., `hotfix/urgent-fix`)

## Commit Message Guidelines

When making commits, please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Keep messages concise but descriptive enough to understand the change.

### Examples
- `Add new inventory file`
- `Fix typo in README`

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.
2. **Clone your fork**: Use the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/infra_ansible.git`.
3. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
4. **Make your changes**: Implement your feature or fix.
5. **Commit your changes**: Use the commit message guidelines outlined above.
6. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
7. **Open a pull request**: Go to the original repository and click on "New Pull Request".

## Code Style and Standards

- Ensure your YAML and JSON files are properly formatted and validated.
- Follow best practices for Jinja templating.
- Consider adding tests for any new features or changes.

## Pull Request Process

When you open a pull request:
- Provide a clear description of your changes.
- Ensure your branch is up to date with the main branch.
- Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers.

### Merge Requirements
- All pull requests must pass any existing tests.
- Code should be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.

## Issue Reporting

To report a bug or request a feature:
1. Check if the issue has already been reported.
2. If not, open a new issue with a clear description of the problem or feature request.
